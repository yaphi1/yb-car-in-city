# TODO

- Tighten checkpoint angle tolerance without creating jitters
- Make auto path generation
  - navigation.ts: clean up makeRoadCheckpoints
  - see if there's a way to space checkpoints more evenly (may be useful for consistent lane changing)
- Consider capping top speed in proportion to turn angle
- Consider obstacle avoidance
- Consider adding traffic
