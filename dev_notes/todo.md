# TODO

- in useSelfDriving, refactor obstacle avoidance to be less confusing
- tighten turn radius for longer turns (maybe change rate, maybe change max)
- consider journey builder that uses turns (left, right, center) to generate intersections to prevent accidental diagonals
- Consider capping top speed in proportion to turn angle
